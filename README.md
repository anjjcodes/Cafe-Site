# Cafe-Site
I've always dreamt of an aesthetic cafe.
While I may not be a chef (yet 😅), I realized — “Hey, I can create one!” So I did... with code.

So this is my "kutti" project.
It’s not fully original, but the learning, structure, and finish? That’s all me ❤️

🖥️ I built the front-end of a café delivery website 
From designing the menu to styling the cart and setting up states, I used this project to truly understand how React works — not just by reading, but by doing.

Here’s what I worked on:

🌐 Tech Stack
React.js – learned and used it to build dynamic and reusable components

CSS – styled everything with an aesthetic, modern, and lavender-inspired theme

JSX – for clean component structure

🍰 Key Features I Built
🛍️ Explore Menu Section: Users can browse through categories.

🧾 Cart System: Real-time cart updates — add/remove items, total updates instantly

💜 Lavender Aesthetic: I themed the entire UI with soft pastels, especially lavender (coz I love lavender)

🔁 Reusable Components: Menu items, headers, footers all created as clean components

🔐 Login/Signup UI: Popup with close button & animation for a polished touch

🖼️ Assets Handling: Integrated images and icons for that delicious food look


This wasn’t about building a giant app. It was about starting somewhere.

✅ I followed a tutorial — paused, rewound, Googled things, and asked questions.
✅ And through that process... I learned React. I learned to build. I built confidence.

Before this, I struggled with React projects.
I’d learn concepts, but couldn’t structure or apply them properly — I’d get lost in my own code.
But thru a real hands-on project, I learned to organize my files and think in components

I know there’s still so much I can improve, and honestly — I’m excited about that.
This was just the start. I really want to turn this into a full-stack café app someday.

📢And to everyone who feels like they’re not doing enough unless they “build from scratch”:
Learning by doing is powerful. Tutorials are not shortcuts — they’re stepping stones.
And this “kutti” café project? It was my stepping stone into frontend development.
